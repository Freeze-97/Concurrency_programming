Why the efficiency of the program is not increased with an increased number of threads?

Because it is a queue which has a fixed size where only one consumer at the time can actually lock and consume an element.
So increasing the number of threads would only result in more threads waiting in the queue for their turn to producer or consume.
The only thing you are gonna get is less elements per thread but it will not increase the performanc.
